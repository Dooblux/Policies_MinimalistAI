Minimalist AI – Privacy Policy

Last updated: 13 November 2025

Minimalist AI (“the App”) is developed by the owner of this repository
(“we”, “us”, “our”). This policy explains how the App handles data and
device permissions.

1.  Information the App Processes When a user interacts with the App,
    any text, prompts, or other content entered into the App may be
    transmitted to OpenAI’s API for processing as part of the App’s
    functionality.

Examples of data that may be sent to OpenAI: - User-entered text -
Prompts - API instructions - Any content the user explicitly submits

The App does not automatically collect or transmit data without the user
initiating the action.

2.  Purpose of Sending Data The App sends user-provided content to
    OpenAI solely to:

-   Generate responses
-   Perform actions based on user prompts
-   Provide the app’s core AI functionality

No other third parties receive your data.

3.  No Data Storage by the App The App does not:

-   Store data on external servers
-   Maintain personal profiles
-   Create accounts
-   Save content beyond temporary processing in the OpenAI API requests

Data is only sent to OpenAI when required to perform the requested
operation.

OpenAI processes data according to its own privacy policy:
https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

4.  Camera Permission If the App uses the camera (e.g., for scanning or
    capturing content), the permission is used solely for local image
    capture.

Images are never stored or uploaded unless the user explicitly submits
them to the app’s AI features. If an image is sent to OpenAI for
analysis, this is done only after the user initiates the action.

5.  No Advertising, Analytics, or Tracking The App does not use:

-   Ads
-   Analytics
-   Background tracking
-   Marketing tools
-   Behavioral profiling

No data is shared with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

6.  Children’s Privacy The App is not designed to collect personal
    information from children.

7.  Data Security Data is transmitted securely using HTTPS. No data is
    stored by the App itself.

8.  Changes to This Policy If functionality changes, this policy will be
    updated.



Service Availability Disclaimer:

This app provides an image- and text-based item evaluation feature that relies on external AI services (currently OpenAI). Users pay a one-time purchase price for access to the app, but the continued availability of the AI-powered functionality depends on third-party API costs and service conditions.

API usage can become significantly more expensive over time. To prevent unsustainable operating costs, the AI-related functionality may be limited, suspended, or discontinued at any moment. If this occurs, the core app will remain accessible, but features that depend on external API calls—such as submitting photos or descriptions for AI evaluation—will no longer function.

No refunds or ongoing service guarantees are provided for the AI component. By using the app, you acknowledge that the AI-powered features are dependent on third-party services outside the developer’s control and may be changed or removed without notice.
